# OPR-GrimdarkFuture-TC
So this was orginally a private idea to help my 8yo and his friends but I thought this might be eventually useful once I try and adapt a custom gamesystem for playing OPR's Grimdark Future in Foundary VTT.

Card number sequences conforms to the following pattern:

[A][000][B]

where 
A       is the Card Series; Series A being Core Cards such as Rules and Special Rules.  Series B - Y denotes the Army Faction

000     Is the numeric model number

B       Is the weapon variant of that model

* NOTE * Captial letter i's and o's have been omitted from this system to remove possible confusion with one (1) and zero (0).

EG. The Eternal Dynasty's Samurai Titan with the default Heavy Titan Sword has a card number of H028A whist the upgraded variant with a Heavy Lazer Rifle is H028B.  This will make more sense when you view the other files and the example card.

If someone has a better system, let me know. But when you consider that by removing i's ad o's from the convention leaves only 24 alpha characters and there's 22 main armies excluding detachments and hive city factions i thought this would look more appealing.

To make things much more open to creating your own and supporting any colaborative efforts, I've pulled svg icons from the team over at Game Icons (https://game-icons.net/).  Feel free to help them along at their Git (https://github.com/game-icons/icons/issues) 

Any filenames used in the associated registers will correlate there; as their project grows the hope is that the need to potentially double up on select icons may diminish but in the short-term I've used BLACK backgrounds to infer SPECIAL RULES, YELLOW backgrounds for PSYCHIC and lastly GREEN for OBJECTIVE/MISSION
